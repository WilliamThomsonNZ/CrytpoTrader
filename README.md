# CryptoTrader

CryptoTrader simulates the experience of trading in the cryptocurrency markets. The app will assign a certain amount of practice currency when the account is created then allow you to make trades as if you were trading with real currency. CryptoTrader will then track the performance of your portfolio and allow you to learn before committing to the real deal.

# Motivation

The motivation for this application is to create a tool that will help people, including myself, to learn the cryptocurrency markets before spending and risking money.

# Technology Used

CryptoTrader is being built on Firebase with React on the front end. CoinGeckos public API will provide data on cryptocurrency prices.
